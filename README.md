# WillowTree Web

This is my attempt to convert (WillowTree#)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/willowtree/] from a C# app to a web one.

## Why?

I don't like either C# or Windows (thanks Microslop for all the AI bullshit!). Also, after a quick look on WillowTree# source code, I was left with the impression that it doesn't do anything special that justifies it being a desktop-only app. So I asked for an LLM model to hallucinate on the WillowTree source code to help me understand it a bit more and now I'm rewriting it as a Svelte app that can be used by anyone (hopefully...)
